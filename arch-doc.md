# üß¨ Template

This is a template created by Diego Pacheco which the goal to better describe a tought process which is called architecture. This should be used to learn software architecture and to pratice with use cases.

## üèõÔ∏è Structure

### 1. üéØ Problem Statement and Context

````
Mr Bill wants a system to keep track of his favorite POCs. You need to build a mobile app where Mr Bill can register all his pocs, and he also needs to be able to search POCs by: name, language, by tags. This system should be multi-tenant, because Mr Bill will sell the system to a bunch of people in Brazil. Such system must also have the ability to generate reports and generate a video with all the pocs the user did in 1 year.

Such system must be secure and have proper login and be able to support realtime dojos using the Mr Bill platform you will build for him.
````


### 2. üéØ Goals

1. Reliable solution with a balance between high availability and cost efficiency.
2. Robust security
3. Follow good practices of code
4. Modern technology stack
5. Designed for anti-fragility

### 3. üéØ Non-Goals

1. Usage of Lambdas
2. A monolith or distributed monoliths
3. Single AZ solutions
4. No Ionic
5. We need a single language for mobile, needs to be native
6. No MongoDB
7. Having a single Relational DB for everything
8. Clouds other than AWS

### üìê 3. Principles

1. Low coupling - stray very far away from monoliths or distributed monoliths.
2. Reliability - design a highly available and reliable system
3. Security - follow good security practices with multi-layer security

### üèóÔ∏è 4. Overall Diagrams

Here there will be a bunch of diagrams, to understand the solution.
```
üóÇÔ∏è 4.1 Overall architecture: Show the big picture, relationship between macro components.
üóÇÔ∏è 4.2 Deployment: Show the infra in a big picture. 
üóÇÔ∏è 4.3 Use Cases: Make 1 macro use case diagram that list the main capability that needs to be covered. 
```

### üß≠ 5. Trade-offs

List the tradeoffs analysis, comparing pros and cons for each major decision.
Before you need list all your major decisions, them run tradeoffs on than.
example:
Major Decisions: 
```
1. One mobile code base - should be (...)
2. Reusable capability and low latency backends should be (...)
3. Cache efficiency therefore should do (...)
```
Tradeoffs:
```
1. React Native vs (Flutter and Native)
2. Services vs Serverless
3. Redis vs Enbeded Caches
```
Each tradeoff line need to be:
```
PROS (+) 
  * Benefit: Explanation that justify why the benefit is true.
CONS (+)
  * Problem: Explanation that justify why the problem is true.
```

Major Decisions:

1. No monoliths
2. Single native language for mobile
3. Multiple DBs - not one relational DB for everything
4. Restricted to AWS

Tradeoffs:
## 1. SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) vs Monoliths

PROS: 
  -  Better isolation
  - Horizontal Scalability
  - No Single Point of Failure

CONS:
  - Higher time to market (more development time)
  - Might be unnecessary spending if the platform is not used enough


## 2. Services vs Serverless

PROS:
  - Predictable performance
  - No need to worry about cold starts

CONS:
  - More infrastructure management
  - Might be more expensive than serverless depending on the workflows

## 3. Multiple DBs vs One Relational DB

PROS:
- Specialized DBs will incur better performance
- No distributed monolith
- Loosen coupling

CONS:
- Higher cost to maintain
- Higher integration between data sources and services needed

## 4. Restrict to AWS vs Private Cloud

PROS:
- Need to worry less about maintenance
- Usage of managed services will ease development and operations

CONS:
- If many managed solutions are used you might end up with vendor lock-in
- If using pay-as-you-go cost might be a big issue

### üåè 6. For each key major component

What is a majore component? A service, a lambda, a important ui, a generalized approach for all uis, a generazid approach for computing a workload, etc...

### üñπ 10. Data Store Designs

For each different kind of data store i.e (Postgres, Memcached, Elasticache, S3, Neo4J etc...) describe the schemas, what would be stored there and why, main queries, expectations on performance. Diagrams are welcome but you really need some dictionaries.

### üñπ 11. Technology Stack

Describe your stack, what databases would be used, what servers, what kind of components, mobile/ui approach, general architecture components, frameworks and libs to be used or not be used and why.
